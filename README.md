I had an incredible time during the Piscine at 1337 School, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves programming, even if they're not considering attending the school. While it was an intense month of non-stop learning, it was also a memorable experience that was packed with enjoyable moments. If you're looking to challenge yourself and learn as much as possible in a short amount of time, then the Piscine is definitely worth considering.
